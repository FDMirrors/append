        * Fix hang when switches appear before the path in the command line.
          Now the path can be at any point in the command line. Differs from
          MS APPEND, but it is saner. Thanks to Bernd Blaauw for reporting
          this bug.

        * Path is no longer ignored when /E is specified, append aborts with
          an error. Again, it differs from its MS counterpart, but it is also
          saner. Thanks to Eric Auer for pointing this out.
